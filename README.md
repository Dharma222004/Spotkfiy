# Spotkify 🎵

> Authentic Spotify Web Player interface powered by a **metadata-driven music library engine** and Cloudinary audio streaming.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Zero Hardcoding**: Artists, songs, albums, and categories are dynamically extracted and synthesized from metadata text files (`Meta Data/`) and synced with Cloudinary (`Songs/` folder).
- **Multi-Artist Indexing**: Every credited artist in a song's credits belongs to the song, and a song belongs to every relevant artist.
- **Dynamic Artist Discography Pages**: Immersive hero banners, verified badges, song counts, "Play All", and full track tables.
- **Clickable Multi-Artist Chips**: Clicking any artist name anywhere across the UI opens their dynamic artist page.
- **Dynamic Search**: Instant search matching song titles, partial artist names, and multi-artist combinations.
- **Authentic Spotify UI/UX**:
  - 3-panel isolated layout with 8px gutters
  - Ambient mesh gradients
  - Greeting cards with hover play
  - Now Playing & Queue side drawer
  - Fullscreen ambient player
  - Bottom player bar with seeking, volume, shuffle, and repeat
- **Security Gate**: Protected login screen (`sharu` / `sharu@123`).
- **Cloudinary CDN Integration**: High-bitrate audio streamed securely from Cloudinary.
